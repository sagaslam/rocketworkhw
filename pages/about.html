            <h1>OUR SUBSYSTEMS</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            At Rocket Works, we believe rocketry is a team effort, every part of
            the rocket is connected, and one design choice can affect the whole
            project. That’s why our subsystem teams aren’t isolated groups
            working on their own; instead, we encourage open communication and
            collaboration across all areas. While each member specialises in a
            certain subsystem, we also promote learning from one another, so
            everyone gains a broader understanding of the rocket to allow the
            team to become more adaptable and allows integration between
            subsystems.
          </p>
          <h2>ENGINEERING</h2>
          <h4>Airframe</h4>
          <p>
            The Airframe team brings the rocket to life by designing and
            building its main structure and aerodynamic features. From shaping
            the rocket’s body to ensuring it can withstand powerful thrust and
            flight loads, this team turns ideas into the physical model. If you
            enjoy hands-on engineering, structural design, and seeing your work
            take shape in the real world, Airframe is where rockets become
            reality.
          </p>
          <h4>Flight Dynamics</h4>
          <p>
            Flight Dynamics is all about predicting, simulating, and controlling
            how our rocket flies. Using powerful software and real flight data,
            this team makes sure the rocket is stable, safe, and hits its target
            apogee. If you like physics, coding, problem-solving, and seeing
            numbers turn into real-world results, Flight Dynamics puts you in
            charge of the rocket’s journey.
          </p>
          <h4>Propulsion</h4>
          <p>
            The Propulsion team delivers the power behind our rockets. From
            integrating commercial solid motors for our first EuRoC launch, to
            developing our very own liquid rocket engine, this team is where
            engineering meets fire and thrust. If you’re fascinated by engines,
            fuel, and pushing the limits of what’s possible, Propulsion is the
            team for you.
          </p>
          <h4>Avionics</h4>
          <p>
            Avionics is the brain and nervous system of the rocket. This team
            designs and builds the electronics that control, monitor, and
            communicate with the rocket during flight. From telemetry and
            tracking to recovery and stability systems, Avionics makes sure we
            know exactly what’s happening at every stage. If you’re into coding,
            electronics, or solving complex challenges, this is the perfect
            place to innovate.
          </p>
          <h4>Payload</h4>
          <p>
            The Payload team focuses on what the rocket carries, from
            experimental satellites like CubeSats to creative mission concepts.
            This is the team where imagination meets engineering, developing
            payloads that generate valuable data and showcase innovation. If you
            want to design experiments that fly to the edge of space, Payload
            offers a chance to push science and technology skyward.
          </p>

          <h2>OPERATIONS</h2>
          <h4>Outreach</h4>
          <p>
            Outreach is the team’s voice to the outside world. Whether it’s
            securing sponsorships, building partnerships, or engaging with the
            university and industry, this team helps ensure Rocket Works has the
            support and recognition it needs. If you’re confident, organised,
            and enjoy making connections, Outreach is where you can make a real
            impact beyond engineering.
          </p>
          <h4>Media</h4>
          <p>
            The Media team is all about telling our story. From managing our
            social platforms to creating videos, photos, and updates, they keep
            the world engaged with our progress. If you’re creative, enjoy
            content creation, or want to build a professional media presence,
            Media is your chance to shape how Rocket Works is seen.
          </p>
          <h4>Logistics</h4>
          <p>
            The Logistics team keeps everything moving smoothly, from organising
            test days and travel to ensuring the rocket and equipment get where
            they need to be, safely and on time. They also develop checklists
            and procedures that keep launches professional and secure. If you’re
            highly organised, enjoy planning, and want to be at the centre of
            making launches happen, Logistics is key to mission success.
