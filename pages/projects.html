          </header>
          <p>
            Rocket Works is developing two projects. Project Skye is our first
            student-built rocket, designed with CAD, FEA, and CFD tools, and
            powered by a commercial solid motor to compete at the European
            Rocketry Challenge (EuRoC) in Portugal in 2026.<br /><br />
            Running in parallel, Project Lomond is our long-term ambition: the
            design, build, and hot-fire of a student-developed bi-propellant
            liquid rocket motor, with the goal of competing in Race2Space and
            entering the SRAD-Liquid category at EuRoC 2027. Together, these
            projects lay the foundation for Rocket Works to push the boundaries
            of student rocketry in the UK.

              Skye is our first major rocket build, where the team will design,
              engineer, and launch a high-powered solid-motor rocket capable of
              reaching altitudes of up to 9 km. The project combines advanced
              CAD design, FEA and CFD validation, and hands-on manufacturing to
              deliver a competition-ready rocket. The desired outcome is a
              successful launch at the European Rocketry Challenge (EuRoC) in
              October 2026.

              Lomond is our long-term endeavour to design, build, and hot-fire a
              bi-propellant liquid rocket motor. Alongside technical research
              into fuel and oxidiser combinations, the project aims to develop,
              test, and validate a functioning liquid engine capable of powering
              a rocket for competition. The desired outcome is to compete at
              Race2Space in the summer of 2027 and enter the SRAD-Liquid
              category at EuRoC the following October.
